    "# Building a Deep Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a deep learning model, we basically use the sequential model of Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the Embedding layer is located. There are two options of setting embedding layers: using the pre-trained word embedding or training new embedding from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, a series of **convolution 1D** and **pooling layers** are added according to typical CNN for text analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to check the effects of the number of convolution layers, we made the function below configurable to set the number of additional convolution layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, after flattening layer, fully connected dense layers are added.\n",
    "Since this is a binary classification problem, we use the sigmoid function as an activation function for the final dense layer. If you try to predict a score of a review, it would be better to use 'softmax' function as the activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Activation Function**  \n",
    "  The activation function is used as a decision making body at the output of a neuron. The neuron learns Linear or Non-linear decision boundaries based on the activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  It also has a normalizing effect on the neuron output which prevents the output of neurons after several layers to become very large, due to the cascading effect.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  There are three most widely used activation functions:\n",
    "      - **Sigmoid**: It maps the input (x axis) to values between 0 and 1 (which may later results in the [vanishing gradient problem](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-vanishing-gradient-problem-69bf08b15484).\n",
    "      - **Tanh**: It is similar to the sigmoid function but maps the input to values between -1 and 1.\n",
    "      - **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**: - It allows only positive values to pass through it. The negative values are mapped to zero.\n",
    "  - **Dropout**  \n",
    "  During training, when dropout is applied to a layer, some percentage of its neurons (a hyperparameter, with common values being between 20 and 50%) are randomly deactivated or “dropped out,” along with their connections. Which neurons are dropped out are constantly shuffled randomly during training. This forces the network to learn a more balanced representation, and **helps with overfitting**."
